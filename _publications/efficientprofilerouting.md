This paper introduces a powerful, efficient and generic framework for optimal routing of electric vehicles in the setting of flexible edge cost functions and arbitrary initial states.
More precisely, the introduced state-based routing problem is a consolidated model covering energy-efficiency and time-dependency. Given two vertices and an initial state the routing problem is to find optimal paths yielding minimal final states, while the profile routing problem is to find optimal paths for all initial states. A universal method for applying shortest path techniques to profile routing is developed. To show the genericity and efficiency of this approach it is instantiated for two typical shortest path algorithms, namely for A* and Contraction Hierarchies. Especially using the latter, a highly efficient solution for energy-efficient profile routing is obtained.
